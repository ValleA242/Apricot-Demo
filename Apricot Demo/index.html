							<h1>Welcome Turning Winds Residential Center</h1>
							<p>My name is Alicio Valle and I will be providing you and your team with an Apricot Software Demonstration on April, 6th 2022. As you scroll down this page you will be walked through a summarized version of what will be covered in our upcoming live demonstration. My hope is that this presents you with an opportunity for you and your team to familiarize yourselves with what is to come as well as serve as a reference to the Apricot Software after the live demonstration is complete. I am looking forward to working with you and your team.

									<h2>Overview of Staff Survey</h2>
									<p>When asked what workflow your team wanted to see in the software demo, Client Intake was the most requested, with Client Assessments at a distant second, and Client Profiles third. Due to this, the demonstration will focus on walking through a Client Intake workflow that will include a Client Assessment.</p>

									<p>Unique credentials and unique privileges means increased security in a more productive digital work environment that is specific to the duties of each staff member.
									<br>
									<br>
									Web Based Applications means easy access, low maintenance and high security. Apricot can be easily accessed through any web browser doing away with the need to install software on individual computers. Another benefit of Apricot's web based approach is all data is stored on our secure servers managed by a team of highly qualified Network Security Professionals.

									<h2>Entering a New Client</h2>
									<p>Through homepage shortcuts we can quickly navigate into our new client information page. On this page we interact with demographic forms, entering the client into a new workflow, and highlight Apricot's useful widgets.</p>

									<h2>Moving Through the Intake Workflow</h2>
									<p>After filling out and saving client demographic information we will move into enrolling our new client. Here we assign a start date for services, a staff member to work with our client, and what program they are entering at our organization. The demonstration will highlight the usefulness of widgets and the ease of use Apricot Software presents its users with.</p>

									<h2>Client Assessments</h2>
								<p>
									Apricot features a number of assessments you can use within the workflow. This streamlines productivity creating an efficient digital work environment. In this demonstration we will go through filling out one of these surveys and discuss how data is stored and can be used to assess your clients.

									<h2>Entering Service Plan</h2>
									<p>Now that we have our client demographics and assessment data, we can move onto finalizing their service plan. Here we can describe the client's symptoms, layout the services the client will receive, create goals for the client, and more. Once saved, all of this info is stored under the clients profile and the client intake is officially complete.</p>

									<h2>Ideas Portal</h2>
									<p>Now that we have gotten to see a completed workflow in the Apricot system, we might have thought of some ways we can make it even better. With apricot there is a place for that known as the Ideas Portal. The Ideas Portal is a service within the application that allows users to submit ideas for changes. Acting as a community of users, other users are able to vote on suggestions they think will be beneficial which will increase the visibility of said suggestions. These suggestions help make Apricot maintain constant inovation that is relevant to the most important stakeholder, the user.</p>
